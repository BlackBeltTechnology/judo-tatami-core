## Branches

Versioning policy of JUDO NG modules are based on GitFlow: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

Branches:

- **develop**: development branch contains latest development sources of the last active version
- **feature/JNG-NUMBER_short_summary**: feature branches are based on **develop** and contains sources of new features that will be included in last active version
- **(release/)1_0_beta1**: release branches of 1.0-beta1 (release/ prefix is still reserved for CI)
- **bugfix/JNG-NUMBER_short_summary**, **support/JNG-NUMBER_short_summary**: bugfix and support branches are based on release branches and must be applied to release and development branches of newer versions too
- **master**: contains latest released sources of the last active version

## Version numbers

Version numbers are increased using semantic versioning:

- do not change version numbers on starting feature/ branches
- 2nd number in version of **develop** branch is increased when a release branch started
- do not change version numbers on bugfix/ branches - that are applied on release branches during testing before releasing it (merging to master)
- 3rd number in version of support/ branches is increased when started - it is used to support a previous release including new (minor) changes; support/ branches are merged back to release branch when update is released (without merging changes to master)
- 4th number in version of hotfix/ branches is increased when started (that are applied on both release and master branches)

## How to develop

For issue tracking we are using [JIRA](https://blackbelt.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards). Golden rule:

> **IMPORTANT:** *There is no commit without ticket number*

So for pull request or commit `JNG-xxx` have to be presented in the commit.
